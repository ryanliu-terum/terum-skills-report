# Build notes

Decisions made while building against the locked spec (`docs/spec.md`, rev 2) and the decision
walk (`docs/decision-walk.md`). Each refines a rule the spec states in general terms, or records
what a real run on a Windows machine on 2026-09-24 (136 skills, 63 sessions) changed. None
reopens a walked fork. Where a note narrows what leaves the machine, §2.6 (never collected) and
§5.5 (no identity) won over the broader wording elsewhere.

## Resolved from spec §13 "not yet checked"

- **Noise filter field.** It is `entrypoint` (`cli` for a person at a terminal, `sdk-cli` for
  every eval sandbox and SDK run), not `userType`, which is `external` on both. Verified against
  current transcripts before any usage code was written. A record with no `entrypoint` at all
  predates the field and is kept.
- **gitleaks.** Not vendored. The seven shapes the spec names fit in a page of our own regular
  expressions (`src/lib/redact.ts`), which is easier for the engineer to read than a rule set.
- **`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.** Resolved to the plugin's `installPath` from `installed_plugins.json`,
  with or without braces. Outside a plugin skill it is recorded as a miss.

## Usage rows (spec §2.3, §3.1)

- **A turn is one model response** (one API call), the meaning Claude Code itself gives the word.
  `turns` in `sessions.csv` counts them across the session, subagents included; `turns_after` in
  `firings.csv` counts them inside the firing's exchange after the firing.
- **Tokens are counted once per `message.id`.** Claude Code writes one assistant response as
  several records (a text block, a tool_use block) that all carry the same `usage`. Measured: 50
  records, 23 ids in one session.
- **A human message** is a user record that is not all tool results, not `isMeta`, not a harness
  task notification, and has text left after the system-reminder and command plumbing is
  removed. A typed slash command is a human message and a D2 firing. An interruption marker is
  counted as an interruption and does not open an exchange. `promptSource` is not required,
  so older transcripts without the field still split into exchanges.
- **Two skills that fire in one exchange both own it**, as the locked definition implies, so
  firing rows can overlap; session rows never do. The manifest says so under the columns.
- **`interrupted_after` is a count**, not a flag, for consistency with `interruptions`.
- **`refired_in_session`** is true when the same skill fires again later in the session.
- **`skill_text_tokens`** is an estimate at four characters per token; the manifest says so.
- **Subagent join.** The launching record is a user tool_result whose `toolUseResult.agentId`
  names `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`. A subagent launched outside any firing still
  counts for the session.
- **Transcript folder names and session file names are never written.** A project folder under
  `~/.claude/projects` is named after the project's full path with dashes, and a file after its
  session id. Skipped files are reported as `<folder n>/<hashed id>.jsonl`.
- **Headless transcripts** (every record `sdk-cli`) are counted and not read into rows.

## Linked scripts (spec §2.2 against §2.6)

- **Only `SKILL.md` is scanned for references.** Scanning every Markdown file in a skill found
  736 misses on one machine, most of them code examples in plugin reference documents.
- **Never copied, whatever references them:** `.env` files, `settings.json`,
  `settings.local.json`, `.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.credentials.json`, SSH and key files,
  `.jsonl` transcripts, `.log` files, and `CLAUDE.md` without `--include-claude-md`. Before this
  rule the run copied `~/.claude/settings.json` (permissions and hooks) because five skills name
  it.
- **A project file is copied only from skill machinery folders** (`.claude/`, `scripts/`,
  `workflows/`, `hooks/`, `bin/`, `tools/`). A skill that mentions `lib/phase1.ts` or an API
  route file is pointing at application source, which §2.6 says never leaves; the reference is
  listed as *found, not copied* so the eval knows it exists.
- **Tokens with regex escapes** (`api\.cohere\.ai`) are not paths.
- **Guards:** a resolved path must lie inside the base it was resolved against, so `../.env`
  cannot climb out; absolute paths outside the project and `~/.claude` are not opened.

## Redaction (spec §5.4, walk D4)

- **A literal must be shaped like a secret**: at least eight characters with a digit, or sixteen
  without. Paths, URLs, constant names, calls, type names and short prose are not literals. The
  plain rule flagged 338 lines on one machine, every one a code word (`key: string`,
  `const key = 'compact'`, `max_tokens = 4096`); the shaped rule flags 29, all long code words.
  A wrong match still only costs one *not evaluable* skill, as the walk accepted.
- **Plural keywords are dropped** (`tokens`, `keys`, `secrets`, `passwords`): in code they name
  counts and containers. `credentials` stays; `apikey`, `pwd`, `authorization` and `bearer` are
  added; `Authorization: Bearer <token>` redacts the token, not the word.
- **Email addresses are a redaction rule.** §5.5 allows no email in the bundle and skills carry
  `author: Name <email>` lines. scp-style git remotes and npm scopes are left alone.
- **Hook commands take the redaction pass too** when `--include-hooks` is on. They are written
  into the manifest rather than copied as files, so they bypassed the copier; on one machine a hook
  command carried a `--secret-header "x-…-secret: <uuid>"` argument. Redactions there are listed
  in `FLAGGED.md` against `MANIFEST.md`, with the hook's position as the line.
- **Files over 2 MiB are not copied** and are listed; **binary files** (a NUL byte in the first
  8 KiB) are copied without a scan and listed as unscanned; `node_modules` and `.git` inside a
  skill folder are not copied and are listed.

## Identity (spec §5.5)

- **The home folder listed as a project** in `~/.claude.json` is skipped: its `.claude` is the
  home one and its base name is the username.
- **Every spelling of the home path** is scrubbed: as given, its resolved real path, forward and
  back slashes, JSON-escaped, `file://`, and the derived Windows 8.3 short names (`RYANLI~1`).
  The output folder and the command line in `collector.txt` are written in the resolved
  spelling, never as typed.
- **Hostnames of five characters or more** are replaced at word boundaries; shorter ones are
  ordinary words.
- **Git error messages** have their paths cut out before they are recorded, because git spells
  paths its own way.

## From the adversarial review (2026-09-24)

An independent review of the repository at its release-ready commit, pointed at the handoff's two
questions (does anything leave that the manifest does not list; does anything get opened that the
spec does not name), reproduced three leaks and listed a dozen smaller gaps. Every finding was
re-read against the code and fixed with a planted case in the leak test unless noted.

- **UTF-16 text was treated as binary** (a NUL in every other byte) and copied unscanned; a
  PowerShell script saved by Windows shipped its key. Encoding is now detected by byte-order mark
  or by the NUL pattern, the text is decoded, redacted, scrubbed and written back in its own
  encoding with its mark, so the script still runs.
- **Error messages carried paths.** A transcript that could not be opened recorded Node's message,
  which names the file and its folder, and the folder is the project path with dashes and the
  username in it. Every recorded reason is now the error code (`EBUSY`, `EACCES`), never the
  message.
- **The never-collected list applied to linked files only.** A `.env`, an SSH key, a log or a
  `settings.local.json` inside a skill folder shipped with the skill. One list (`src/lib/never.ts`)
  now guards every copy path, and `__pycache__` and virtual environments are skipped folders,
  because compiled Python carries the absolute source path.
- **A project above the home folder** (`C:\`, `/Users`) listed in `~/.claude.json` made
  `--hash-labels` show the username inside display paths. Ancestors of home are never projects.
- **Hints carried value characters:** six for shapes, so an email hint showed `ryan.l…` and a
  connection-string password's first six letters. A hint is now the rule's fixed prefix (`sk-ant-`)
  or a length only.
- **Passwords inside URLs** (`postgres://app:pass@host`) were missed by every rule; they are a
  shape rule now. Also caught since: PHP `=>` assignments, `--password value` flags, `.netrc`
  lines, `Authorization: Basic <short base64>`, YAML block scalars with the value on the next
  lines, values starting with `@`, and upper-case values with digits.
- **A git failure other than "not a repository"** (a timeout, `dubious ownership` on a share) was
  treated as not a repository, so the manifest implied the folder had been checked. It is a
  recorded problem now. File names go to git as `:(literal)name`.
- **A plugin's cache folder had no application-source guard;** a plugin installed from a whole
  repository shipped `src/` files a skill mentioned. The machinery rule applies to plugins too.
- **A write failure** (quarantine, a path too long for this Windows, a full disk) aborted the run;
  it is a per-file reason now. **An existing output folder** failed only at the final rename; it
  is refused before any work.
- **The bare account name** is scrubbed at word boundaries when it is five characters or more,
  like the hostname, and percent-encoded home paths are a known spelling.
- **Any machine's home folder** (`/Users/<name>`, `/home/<name>`, `C:\Users\<name>`) becomes `~`,
  not only this machine's: a skill written on a teammate's laptop carried their Mac home path in
  a command example, and §5.5 says no full home path at all.
- **Smaller:** labels that differ only by case are made distinct; the name rule skips lines over
  20,000 characters (its scan is quadratic; the shape rules still run); transcripts over 256 MiB are
  listed, not read; a symbolic link inside a skill folder is followed only when its target stays in
  the folder; non-Markdown files in `commands/` and `agents/` are listed as not copied; `FLAGGED.md`
  lists every file copied without a scan; the screen says that a synced Desktop syncs the folder.
- **Left as noted:** inline sidechain records in a main transcript are dropped in favour of the
  nested files (none seen in 275 local transcripts); a `.partial` folder of the same name from an
  earlier run is replaced.

## Screen and manifest (spec §3, §4)

- The output is built in a `.partial` sibling and renamed at the end, so a crash leaves a folder
  that is visibly unfinished. A folder that already exists gets `-2`, `-3`.
- Without a `Desktop` folder the output goes to the home folder and the screen says so.
- The exit code is non-zero only when the output folder itself cannot be written, or the flags
  are wrong.

## Release path (spec §5.1), 2026-09-25

- **The GitHub Actions Node 22 image bundles npm 10.9.9,** and npm trusted publishing needs 11.5.1
  or newer, so the first dispatch would have failed at `npm publish` with "need auth". The release
  workflow installs npm 11.11.1 first, the pin terum-skills' own releases use (PR #9).
- **npm refuses trusted publishing for a package's first version** (the Trusted Publisher setting
  lives on the package's settings page). Decision 8: a placeholder 0.0.1 published by hand holds
  the name, 1.0.0 comes from the workflow, and the placeholder is unpublished within 72 hours
  (Decision 10). A laptop publish cannot produce provenance, so it was never an option for 1.0.0.
- **The tag is created only once the registry serves the version from the released commit.**
  Decision 9: after `npm publish` the job reads `gitHead` and `dist.integrity` back from npm,
  waiting up to two minutes (PR #10).
- **npm 11 reports a `./`-prefixed `bin` entry as "invalid and removed" at publish time,** while
  `npm pack` and CI's install-from-tarball smoke stay silent. terum-skills' published manifest
  shows npm re-adds the normalised path, so the command survives; but the warning would have
  appeared on every release and the repo would not match the published manifest. `bin` is
  `dist/index.js` now, and CI fails if `npm pkg fix` would change `package.json` (PR #11).
